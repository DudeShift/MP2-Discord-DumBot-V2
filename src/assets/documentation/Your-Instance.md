# Host & Deploy Your Own Instance of DumBot

This document will set you up to have your own version of DumBot that you can fully customize the code of. This documentation will go super in depth so even if you have no coding knowledge you should be able to figure it out. Feel free to open a [discussion](https://github.com/Mateo-Wallace/MP2-Discord-DumBot-V2/discussions) if you are having problems.

> **Note**
>
> Be aware before going through this process my solution to deploying is hosting on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) which is a **PAID** service. I researched into free solutions like [Glitch](https://glitch.com/pricing) but was unable to make it work. Heroku costs $5 for the lowest tier plan. That plan will put DumBot into sleep mode after 30 minutes. For $7 you can bump up your plan and have DumBot running at all times.
>
> If you find a way to run DumBot for free, even if it goes into sleep mode, that information would be amazing! Feel free to message me or open a discussion and I will add you as a contributor to the project.

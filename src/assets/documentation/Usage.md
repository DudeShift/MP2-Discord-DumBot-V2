# Using DumBot And The Existing Commands

This file assumes you have already added a version of DumBot to your discord server. In order to accomplish that if you haven't already please reference either of these files before continuing:

- [Use The Existing Instance of DumBot](./Existing-Instance.md)
- [Host & Deploy Your Own Instance of DumBot](./Your-Instance.md)

### Table of Contents

- [The Help Command](#the-help-command)
- [Description of All DumBot Commands](#description-of-all-dumbot-commands)

> **Note**
>
> It is possible that the first 2 or 3 times you try to call DumBot it will say "`The application did not respond`" like this:
>
> ![dumbot application did not respond](../images/dumbot-no-response-msg.png)
>
> This is happening because without paying a subscription for DumBot to be up at all times he will go into sleep mode. After 2 or 3 tries this will resolve itself for about 30 minutes of use.
>
> If you would like to stop this from happening I recommend you [Deploy Your Own Instance of DumBot](./Your-Instance.md) and pay for his server to be up at all times. It will typically cost about $5 - $8.

## The Help Command

Now that DumBot has been added to your server, lets test that he is working. You should see underneath DumBot that he is `playing /help`. This is your indicator to type `/help` in the chat in order to find out what he can do! It should look like the following image:

![/help command short](../images/dumbot-small-help.png)

Wonderful! Now you have a list of commands and possibly a description for those commands. Every single DumBot command begins with the `/` prefix, examples are `/roll`, `/play`, and `/dumbot`.

### Core Commands

#### /dumbot

`/dumbot` displays a simple message when called. He essentially says `Hello I am DumBot. I am very dumb`. 

DumBot began as a simple project where I wanted to see if I could add a bot to a server and have it respond with the most simple command possible. It has since turned into a new beast to where DumBot isn't so dumb anymore!
